# WebC
A basic web server written in c. Dependencies include GCC and Make.

### To run:
1. Delete the build directory if it exists.
2. Move into the src directory and execute the following command:
```bash
make build
```
3. Move into the newly created build directory and execute the following
command:
```bash
./server
```

The WebC server should now be accessible at the localhost:8000/ endpoint.
